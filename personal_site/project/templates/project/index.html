        Project goal was to compare performance of APIs written in different languages. Languages were Go, Python, and
        JavaScript.
        This project was my introduction to Go. The language was simple and intuitive, and I'd like to write more of it
        in
        the future.
        A full write up of my results and takeaways can be found on the repo.
